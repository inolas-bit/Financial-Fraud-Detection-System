# 💸 Financial Fraud Detection System

A Python-based machine learning project designed to detect fraudulent transactions using unsupervised anomaly detection techniques like **Isolation Forest** and **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**.

## 📊 Project Overview

Financial fraud is a critical challenge in the modern digital economy. This project aims to identify suspicious transactions from a dataset using robust outlier detection algorithms. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model implementation, the goal is to build a scalable and efficient fraud detection pipeline.

## 🧠 Key Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Anomaly Detection:
  - Isolation Forest
  - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Model Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification metrics

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Description: Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, where 492 out of 284,807 are fraudulent.

## 🚀 Outcomes

- Visualized transaction distributions and patterns
- Detected fraudulent patterns using unsupervised ML techniques
- Achieved strong anomaly classification performance
